A Reddit bot connected to a website that allows subreddit moderators to exercise finer control over use flairs for e.g. verification purposes.

- Web-based management panel accessible to all mods with `flair` permissions
  - Allow top mod to change this requirement?
- Based on Reddit emoji
- Allow users to choose their own flair image(s) from a set (or sets)
- Allow mods to create special-purpose images that only they can grant
- Easily allow mods to see who has what flairs
- Allow users to include custom text with their flair at mod discretion
  - Allow moderators to set requirements for the contents of this text, e.g. character limits, word filters, regex filters for implementing things like required link formats
- Somehow gracefully handle the addition or removal of subreddit emojis
